# Sweep AI turns bugs & feature requests into code changes (https://sweep.dev)
# For details on our config file, check out our docs at https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config

# This setting contains a list of rules that Sweep will check for. If any of these rules are broken in a new commit, Sweep will create an pull request to fix the broken rule.
rules:
  - "Each example script in /examples should have a corresponding manual GitHub action created in .github/workflows/example-sh.yml"
  - "All new business logic should have corresponding unit tests."
  - "Refactor large functions to be more modular."
  - "Add docstrings to all functions and file headers."
  - "Add and use fabric (https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric) as a library for this repository"
  - "Commend all of your code like -> https://github.com/divnix/std"
